// Security improvement recommendations for authentication

/**
 * SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
 * 
 * 1. Environment Variables Setup (.env.local):
 */

// Add to .env.local:
/*
JWT_SECRET=your-super-strong-jwt-secret-at-least-256-bits-long
ADMIN_USERNAME=nguyenbinhphuong
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$2b$12$LQv3c1yqBwn2h5z8s9x.xe...  # bcrypt hashed password
*/

/**
 * 2. Rate Limiting Implementation:
 * - Add rate limiting middleware
 * - Track failed login attempts
 * - Implement temporary lockouts
 * 
 * 3. Timing Attack Prevention:
 * - Use constant-time comparison
 * - Always perform password check even for invalid usernames
 * 
 * 4. Enhanced Token Security:
 * - Don't return token in response body
 * - Use shorter token expiration (1-2 hours)
 * - Implement token refresh mechanism
 * 
 * 5. Additional Security Headers:
 * - CSRF protection
 * - Content Security Policy
 * - Strict-Transport-Security
 * 
 * 6. Audit Logging:
 * - Log all authentication attempts
 * - Monitor for suspicious activity
 * - Alert on multiple failed attempts
