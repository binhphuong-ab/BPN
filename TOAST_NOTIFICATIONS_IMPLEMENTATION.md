# Toast Notification Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Alert Dialogs with Toast Notifications

**Before:**
```javascript
alert('Post updated successfully!');
alert(errorData.error || `Failed to ${mode} post`);
alert(`Failed to ${mode} post`);
alert('Post deleted successfully!');
alert('Failed to delete post');
```

**After:**
```javascript
showSuccess('Post updated successfully!');
showError(errorData.error || `Failed to ${mode} post`);
showError(`Failed to ${mode} post`);
showSuccess('Post deleted successfully!');
showError('Failed to delete post');
```

### 2. Added Toast Context Integration

**Import Added:**
```javascript
import { useToast } from '@/contexts/ToastContext';
```

**Hook Usage:**
```javascript
const { showSuccess, showError } = useToast();
```

### 3. Improved Delete Post UX

**Before:** Navigate immediately, then show alert (which was lost)
```javascript
router.push('/admin');
setTimeout(() => {
  alert('Post deleted successfully!');
}, 100);
```

**After:** Show toast first, then navigate with delay to let user see the message
```javascript
showSuccess('Post deleted successfully!');
setTimeout(() => {
  router.push('/admin');
}, 1000);
```

### 4. Fixed ESLint Error

**Fixed unescaped entity:**
```javascript
// Before
"The image path might be incorrect or the file doesn't exist"

// After  
"The image path might be incorrect or the file doesn&apos;t exist"
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Modern toast notifications instead of browser alerts
2. **Consistent Design**: Matches the app's design system
3. **Non-blocking**: Toasts don't interrupt user workflow like alerts do
4. **Customizable**: Can set different types (success, error, warning, info)
5. **Auto-dismiss**: Toasts automatically disappear after a set duration
6. **Better Accessibility**: Toast component supports screen readers

## Toast Types Used

- **Success**: `showSuccess()` - Green background, checkmark icon
- **Error**: `showError()` - Red background, error icon

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/PostEditor.tsx`
   - Added `useToast` import and hook
   - Replaced all 5 `alert()` calls with appropriate toast notifications
   - Fixed ESLint unescaped entity error
   - Improved delete flow UX

## Testing

✅ Build compiles successfully  
✅ TypeScript types are correct  
✅ ESLint passes (with expected img tag warnings)  
✅ All user notifications now use the toast system  

## Toast Configuration

The toasts use the following default settings from ToastContext:
- **Success toasts**: 4 second duration, auto-close
- **Error toasts**: 6 second duration, auto-close  
- **Position**: Fixed top-right corner
- **Animation**: Slide in from right, fade out
- **Manual close**: X button available on all toasts
